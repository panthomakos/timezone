    #
    # @note The UTC equivalent is a "best guess". There are cases where
    #   local times do not map to UTC at all (during a time skip forward).
    #   There are also cases where local times map to two distinct UTC
    #   times (during a fall back). All of these cases are approximated
    #   in this method and the first possible result is used instead.
    #
    # @note A note about the handling of time arguments.
    #
    #   Because the UTC offset of a `Time` object in Ruby is not
    #   equivalent to a single timezone, the `time` argument in this
    #   method is first converted to a UTC equivalent before being
    #   used as a local time.
    #
    #   This prevents confusion between historical UTC offsets and the UTC
    #   offset that the `Time` object provides. For instance, if I pass
    #   a "local" time with offset `+8` but the timezone actually had
    #   an offset of `+9` at the given historical time, there is an
    #   inconsistency that must be resolved.
    #
    #   Did the user make a mistake; or is the offset intentional?
    #
    #   One approach to solving this problem would be to raise an error,
    #   but this means that the user then needs to calculate the
    #   appropriate local offset and append that to a UTC time to satisfy
    #   the function. This is impractical because the offset can already
    #   be calculated by this library. The user should only need to
    #   provide a time without an offset!
    #
    #   To resolve this inconsistency, the solution I chose was to scrub
    #   the offset. In the case where an offset is provided, the time is
    #   just converted to the UTC equivalent (without an offset). The
    #   resulting time is used as the local reference time.
    #
    #   For example, if the time `08:00 +2` is passed to this function,
    #   the local time is assumed to be `06:00`.
